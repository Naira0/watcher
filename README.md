# watcher
a simple file backup script


## Information
* this was made to backup my save files.
* it was made with watchdog.
* it is a fairly simple script so you cant expect to get a lot of usage out of it other then backing up saves or documents.

## Usage

if you just run the script it will promt you for a file path but you can provide the file path with command line args instead.
if you use the run.bat file change the path to the desired path.
